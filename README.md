# Acoustic-Echo-Cancellation
Acoustic Echo Cancellation system for the ADSP-BF533 EZ-KIT Board. Eliminates both simulated and real-world echoes.



I am looking at a very interesting program that is available on GitHub

 kunaljathal / Acoustic-Echo-Cancellation 

The web page will not allow to enter comments or queries.
I would like to ask the following question please.
The code indicates that there are at least five header files need for this program.
I only got one when I downloaded it; Talkthrough.h
Do I need the other headers?
How can I get them please as this looks like a very useful piece of software.
Thank you.
